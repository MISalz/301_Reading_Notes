[Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm) -- The primary objective of component-based architecture is to ensure component reusability.

Component-oriented software design has many advantages over the traditional object-oriented approaches such as −

  * Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.

  * Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components.

A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality.
A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities.a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.

* Object-oriented view-Each problem domain class (analysis) and infrastructure class (design) are explained to identify all attributes and operations that apply to its implementation
* Conventional view-integrates the processing logic, the internal data structures that are required to implement the processing logic and an interface that enables the component to be invoked and data to be passed to it.
* Process-related view-building from existing components maintained in a library

[What is Props and How to Use it in React](https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0)

"Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)

### using Props
1. firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
2. Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
3. Finally, render the Props Data

* Props stand for properties and is a special keyword in React
* Props are being passed to components like function arguments
* Props can only be passed to components in one way (parent to child)
* Props data is immutable (read-only)
